# calculator
Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For this project, I designed a basic structure of a calculator with a screen and buttons in HTML and CSS. Next I wrote functions to perform basic mathematical operations. I linked the number and operator buttons via click event listeners, and linked typed numbers and operators via keyboard event listeners. Then I wrote a function to run every time an operator was selected, and another function to run once two numbers and an operator were present and either the equal was clicked/typed or another operator was clicked/typed.

I added code to clear the screen after equal was clicked/pressed and another number was typed, and edited numbers with many digits after a decimal point to 4 digits after the decimal (and removed the decimal point for whole numbers).
