Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For this project, I designed a basic structure of a calculator with a screen and buttons in HTML and CSS. Next I used JavaScript to write functions to perform basic mathematical operations. I linked the number and operator buttons via click event listeners, and linked typed numbers and operators via keyboard event listeners. Then I wrote a function to run every time an operator was selected, and another function to run once two numbers and an operator were present and either the equal was entered or another operator was entered.

I added code to clear the screen after equal was clicked/pressed and another number was entered, and truncated numbers with many digits after a decimal point.
